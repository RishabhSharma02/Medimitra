# MedMitra App

A new Flutter project.

## About
Our healthcare app is designed to address some of the biggest challenges facing patients today. One of the biggest problems that patients face is remembering to take their medication on time. With our app's easy-to-use medication management system, patients can effortlessly scan their medicines and save them to their digital health records, complete with automatic scheduling and reminders.

In addition to medication management, our app also offers convenient options for general and full body checkups. Patients can easily schedule appointments with our specialists and have their lab tests done at the comfort of their own homes. Our app also features an AI-powered mental health chatbot, which provides 24/7 support to patients in need.

Our medicine scan and save feature is an innovative solution that saves patients from the hassle of keeping track of their paper prescriptions. With the click of a button, patients can scan their prescriptions and have them saved to their digital health records for future consultations.

Overall, our app is designed to provide patients with a seamless and stress-free healthcare experience. With our intuitive user interface, advanced AI/ML technology, and convenient features, we're committed to making healthcare more accessible and convenient for everyone.
